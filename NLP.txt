NLP
Natural Language processing 
commonly used to give words to a machine basically its all about how a machine can understand the human language
It is also about how the computer can able to  understand the contents in the files(text files)


Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.



Let’s suppose that you have to write an autocomplete algorithm. For example, you enter the prefix “car” and the algorithm must return all the stored complete words that have the “car” prefix.


Applications of NLP in real life examples:
1. Auto fill and spell checking
2. Plagarism checking
3. Speech Recognition
4. Sentimental analysis
5. Machine Translation 
6. Keyword Search
7. extracting information
9.Some chatbots like customer service chatbots


Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve  

1. Language understanding
2. Language genaration

Ambiguties inn Language understanding
Lexical Ambiguity

Same words having diffrent meanings 
She is looking for a match.
The fisherman went to the bank.

Syntactic Ambiguity
Sentences have more meanings also known as structural ambiguity
The chicken is ready to eat.
Visiting relatives can be boring.
I saw the man with the binoculars.

Referential Ambiguity

During Speech Recognition and Language understanding the given 
data will undergo some process that what makes a machine can understand 
Now how machine can understand the given data

What we have chosen is Tries 
Tries are a specific kind of tree that can be used to store and retrieve words in a dictionary, it's very optimized for prefix-based operations.

Trie can also be usefull for developing NLP model because a computer does know human language. Therefore, we need to separate a sentence into words then encode them so we can fit it into our NLP model.	






Given an array of strings str[] and a string key, the task is to check if the spelling of the key is correct or not. If found to be true, then print “YES”. Otherwise, print the suggested correct spellings.

We are given a Trie with a set of strings stored in it. Now the user types in a prefix of his search query, we need to give him all recommendations to auto-complete his query based on the strings stored in the Trie. We assume that the Trie stores past searches by the users.
For example if the Trie store {“abc”, “abcd”, “aa”, “abbbaba”} and the User types in “ab” then he must be shown {“abc”, “abcd”, “abbbaba”}.
